SISTEM (SImulation of Single-cell Tumor Evolution and Metastasis) is a software package and mathematical model for simulating tumor evolution,  cell migrations, and DNA-seq data at single-cell resolution. SISTEM simulates tumor populations under somatic clonal selection using an agent-based model. It can be used to simulate ground truth cell or clonal lineages and migration graphs while generating CNA profiles, SNV profiles, bulk-seq read counts, single-cell read counts, and allele-specific scDNA-seq reads. You can find the documentation and a number of examples by following the links appearing below the title. For a quick and easy start to using SISTEM, check out the [Quickstart](https://sistem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) guide for an introduction and the [Wrapper](https://github.com/samsonweiner/sistem/tree/main/wrapper) for end-to-end simulations.
